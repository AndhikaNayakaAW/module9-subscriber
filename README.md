- **`guest:guest`**
    - The first `guest` is the **username** used to authenticate with the RabbitMQ broker.
    - The second `guest` is the **password** for that user.
- **`localhost:5672`**
    - `localhost` indicates the **host** where the RabbitMQ broker is running (in this case, your local machine).
    - `5672` is the **port** on which the RabbitMQ broker listens for AMQP connections.
